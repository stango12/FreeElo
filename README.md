# FreeElo: First League Website Project
This website utilizes the Riot API to grab game data such as runes and item builds from matches with players that are ranked Diamond and higher. With this data, it finds the most used builds and displays the data for others to use. Currently, the website shows the free champs of the week on the homepage, and a user can click on a champion and open his/her webpage to get more info.
